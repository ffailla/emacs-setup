= Clojure-contrib =

The user contributions library, clojure.contrib, is a collection of
namespaces each of which implements features that we believe may be
useful to a large part of the Clojure community.

Clojure-contrib is open source under the Eclipse Public License and is
copyrighted by Rich Hickey and the various contributors.

= Building Clojure-contrib =

If you downloaded a release distribution or pre-compiled JAR, you
don't need to do anything.

If you downloaded the sources from Github, you will need Apache Maven
(2.0 or higher) to run the build.  See http://maven.apache.org/

Run the following command in this directory:

    mvn package

This will produce the file target/clojure-contrib-${VERSION}.jar that
you can add to your Java classpath.

Additional build commands are available:

    mvn clojure:repl
    To start a Clojure REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

    mvn compile
    To compile sources without building a JAR

    mvn test
    To run unit tests

    mvn assembly:assembly
    To build ZIP/tar distributions containing source and JARs

To skip the testing phase when building, add "-Dmaven.test.skip=true"
to the mvn command line.



== Compiling with Local clojure.jar ==

If you want to compile/build with a customized clojure.jar file, use
the following command:

    mvn package -Dclojure.jar=/path/to/clojure.jar

The /path/to/clojure.jar MUST be an absolute path.  

Maven will still download other dependencices,
such as clojure-maven-plugin.
