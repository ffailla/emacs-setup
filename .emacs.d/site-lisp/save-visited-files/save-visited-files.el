;; Save-visited-files.el - save opened files across sessions

;; Copyright (C) 2009 Nathaniel Flath <nflath@gmail.com>
;; Version: 1.2
;;
;; Commentary
;; Save-visited-files is a lightweight version of Desktop.el that
;; only save the files you have open(currently).  This was created because I
;; couldn't ever get Desktop to work and wanted to persist open files across
;; sessions.  This file is the result.
;;
;; To install, put this file somewhere in your load-path and add the following
;; to your .emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'save-visited-files)
;; (turn-on-save-visited-files-mode)
;;
;; This will load the set of saved files on startup, as well as updating this
;; list whenever the auto-save-timer is run.  This does not wait to save on
;; closing emacs because I wanted it to be useful even if emacs crashed.  To
;; save the visited files at any time, you can call M-x save-visited-files-save.
;; M-x save-visited-files-restore will open all files saved this way.  To turn
;; off the saving of files, you need to run (turn-off-save-visited-files-mode)
